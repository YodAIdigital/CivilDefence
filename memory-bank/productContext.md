# Civil Defence Expo - Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

### The Problem
Communities lack a centralized, accessible platform for civil defense information and coordination. Current solutions are:
- Fragmented across multiple government websites
- Not optimized for mobile or offline access
- Lacking community-level coordination tools
- Difficult to access during emergencies when connectivity is limited

### The Solution
Civil Defence Expo provides a unified platform that:
- Centralizes critical emergency information
- Works offline when infrastructure fails
- Enables community-based coordination
- Scales from individual preparedness to community response

## User Experience Goals

### 1. Immediate Value
Users should find value immediately upon visiting:
- Public information accessible without signup
- Clear navigation to relevant content
- Fast loading times
